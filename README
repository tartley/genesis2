Genesis
=======

Run Genesis on a copy of a project template to create a new project.

Usage
=====

::

    genesis [options]

Where options may include::

    dirname             Directory to operate on. Defaults to current.
    name=value          Specifies that tag ``G{name}`` should be replaced with
                        ``value``. Many such name=value pairs can be specified,
                        separated by spaces.
    --version           Show version number and exit.
    --help|-h           Show this help message and exit.

Description
===========

Genesis searches the specified directory (defaulting to the current working
directory), and its subdirectories, replacing tags of the form ``G{name}`` with
values specified on the command-line.

Occurences of tags in file or directory names are also replaced.

Creating a template
--------------------

Genesis does not provide any project templates. It's expected you'll want to
create your own. Take copy of a small recent project, remove the guts of it,
and replace project-specific info with tags, for example: The project name
becomes ``G{name}``, and your own contact email becomes ``G{email}``.

Copy your template into a new project directory, and::

    $ genesis name=myproject email=you@youremail.com

Dependencies
============

Tested on MacOSX, under Python 3.2.

See dependencies.txt for Python packages.

Install
=======

::

    $ pip install genesis

Status & Known Problems
=======================

Minimally feature complete and useable, but requires one or two more features
to be really useful (see 'To Do' below.)

Alternatives
============

I understand Python Paster is a comprehensive alternative. TBH The only reason
this project exists is because I can't find the part of the Paster documentation
that tells me how to use it for this.

Plans
=====

* Specify commonly used tags (e.g author's contact email) in a ~/.genesis file.
* Warn of tags left unreplaced in the template.
