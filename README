Genesis
=======

Command-line executable Python script to create a new project from a template.

Usage
=====

::

    genesis [options]

Where options may include::

    --help|-h           Show this help message and exit.
    --version           Show version number and exit.
    --verbose|-v        Enumerate changes as they are made.
    name=value          Specifies that Tag 'G{name}' should be replaced with
                        'value'. Many such name=value pairs can be specified,
                        separated by spaces.
    dirname             Directory to operate on. Defaults to current.

Description
===========

Genesis searches through all files in the current directory, and its
subdirectories, replacing tags of the form ``G{name}`` with values specified on
the command-line or in a ``~/.genesis`` config file.

Occurences of tags in file or directory names are also replaced.

If the template contains any tags which don't have a defined value, then a
warning is issued, and the project will still have the corresponding tags in
it. To fix this, re-run Genesis with extra ``name=value`` pair added to the
command-line for each of the undefined tags. You might want to consider adding
those name=value pairs to your ``~/.genesis`` config file for next time.

Creating a template
--------------------

Genesis does not provide any project templates. It's expected you'll want to
create your own. Take copy of a small recent project, remove the code, and 
replace things like the project name with ``G{name}``, and your own contact
email with ``G{email}``.

For tag values which are constant across all projects, like your email, put them
into your ``~/.genesis`` file::

    email=me@mine.com

For tag values which vary from one project to the next, you'll need to specify
them on the command-line when you invoke Genesis. Copy your template into a
new project directory, and::

    $ genesis name=myproject

Dependencies
============

Tested on MacOSX, and under Python 3.2.

See dependencies.txt for Python packages.

Install
=======

::

    $ pip install genesis

Status & Known Problems
=======================

Still in development. Not yet useable.

Alternatives
============

I understand Python Paster is a comprehensive alternative. TBH The only reason
this project exists is because I can't find the part of the Paster documentation
that tells me how to use it for this.

Thanks
======

I did it my way.
